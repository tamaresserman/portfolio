          <div class="left">
          <h3>The Task</h3>
          </div>
          <p>I worked in a team at Viasat during summer 2017. Our task was to design an app for Viasat's commercial internet service, Exede. Currently, users only had a website, which was not effective in solving easy problems, such as paying bills or troubleshooting. The goal was to provide an easy experience for customers to quickly access all their internet needs.

        <h3>First Designs </h3>
      </div>
      <p>My team had designed an initial prototype before I joined. At this stage, the app was to mainly be used as a troubleshooting tool, to help people understand why their internet might not be working. 
      </p>

      </video>
      <p>I joined in time for our first round of user testing. I wrote the interview procedure and questions, conducted and documented the interviews, and recommended design changes.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <div class="left">
        <h3>User Testing</h3>
      </div> 
      <p>After three rounds of testing, with 9 users, we found that our color scheme was too distracting, especially for our target audience. We were using big blocks of color that made it hard for users to navigate through the app. Additionally, our users had a hard time understanding the functions of certain buttons, or the flow of certain processes. 
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <img src="exedeold.PNG" alt="exede" style="height:350px;width:204px;"> 
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>For example, users did not realize that to start the reboot process, they simply have to press a button. Users automatically saw the word "reboot", and started having an anxious reacting, looking for a modem to unplug. 
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The information architecture was also causing trouble for users. Users had a hard time figuring out where certain functions would be in the navigation menu. We decided to add a billing menu to the navigation. 
      </p>
      <hr>
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>We toned down the color on the overall design, changed the language on the reboot screen to avoid triggering and incorrect responses, and reduced the amount of screens in the troubleshooting process to make the experience seem shorter and limit the amount of user intervention.
      </p>

      </video>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>We tested users with our new design, and found that when we used the word "refresh" instead of "reboot", users were less tense and pressed the button. They trusted the app to solve the problem. They also understood the process and the navigation.

        <h3>Billing Implementation </h3>
      </div>
      <p>I was working on another project trying to use artificial intelligence to cut customer care costs. I was surprised that most of the calls were billing issues that could easily be solved by an intuitive app or website. After creating use case flows, I designed screens that allowed users to easily manage their payment methods, and understand their bills. </p>

      </video>   
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>After user testing, I changed the layout of some screens. Originally, users were confused between the difference in "past transactions" and "future transactions" because they were placed too close to each other and looked similar. Therefore, I changed the language and placement to make a clear distinction. Additionally, I changed all editable fields to be the same color to remain consistent.

              <p>I worked in a team to analyze current popular music applications such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon music and find opportunities for a better overall design. This analysis was completed through interviews, between-app workflow comparisons, a competitive analysis of Information Architecture, and a final mockup of a prototype redesign.

              <p>In contrast, Spotify's UI for discovering new music is very clear. Immediately, the home screen provides music a user might like based on algorithms.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>We compared the Information Architecture of Apple Play, Amazon Music, and Spotify to understand which platform provided the best and most intuitive navigation which we could integrate into our new design.
            </p>
             <h5>Apple Play</h5>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-5">
                <p>
                  Apple Play has a navigation that is focused on the personalized experience. They have a menu for Library placed to the left, followed by a "For You" recommendation. However, listed under new music is Exclusive Film, Playlists, Hot Tracks, New Releases, and finally Videos. The top display listed under new film is Exclusive Film, which is not really music, and therefore in almost the wrong or unintuitive category.

            <h5>Amazon Music</h5>
            <div class="row"> 
              <div class="col-lg-5"> 
                <p>Amazon Music's structure makes it an easy platform to search for new music. The first item in the nav menu is Browse, and every nav menu includes a search bar on the second level of its hierarchy. There is no social aspect included in the hierarchy, and it only creates a sense of searching for new music, rather than being connected to music other people are listening to.

              <div class="col-lg-5">   
                <p>Spotify lists library at the end of the navigation menu. People generally have the mental model where important items appear first in a list. Music listeners often listened to music in their own library, and were therefore confused when "library" appeared at the end of the navigation menu. Additionally, diving deeper into "genres", there are sections for "Global Top Music" and "Global Viral Music". The distinction between "Top Music" and "Viral Music" are unclear, and grouped together, even though "American Music" and "Country" are paired together. This design is inconsistent and uninformative.

              Prototype
            </h3>
            </div>
            <p>Based on user testing and the Information Architecture Analysis we made several decisions about our app layout. We listed Home Library Friends Discover and Search in that order. Based on our interviews, people mainly want to access their own library, but that they also look to these music apps as a way to find new music. Therefore we added a Discover section to provide additional music recommendations. We also realized throughout our interviews that people rely on their friends for music, and want more of a social aspect to the app. Therefore we included a "Friends" section as a navigation menu. We took inspiration from Amazon's style of providing a search bar in every nav menu, and allowed our users to access their friend's music on the home page, in the "Friends" nav menu, and within Browse. 
            </p>
            <h6>We created a low-fidelity prototype to see what design choices to keep in the final mock-ups</h6>
            <div class="row">

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>We originally showed the song that a friend was listening to right above the picture of a friend. However, we decided this layout was too similar to the current song that a user was listening to. We did not want our users to be confused between their current song playing, and what their friend was currently listening to. Therefore we put the song title below the picture of the friend, and made the design different than that of the music a user is listening to.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              Overall this design is a lot more social based and provides a clear flow for user scenarios. It allows users the option to share a song, discover new music and artists, and easily manage their playlists.

              <p>Based on all of this user testing, we defined the problem that there is too much information happening in intersections. Drivers have to be aware of pedestrians and cyclists who often come out of nowhere, directions, and important street information. All of this information can cause cognitive overload, and overwhelm drivers which leads to mistakes.

              <p>The idea was to have cylclists, cars, and pedestrians all on different levels of streets to prevent contact between any stakeholder. This idea obviously was not feasible, however it made us think about ways to make the interaction between these parties safer.

              <br>
              <p>We also thought about putting retractable spikes in the streets that would pop up when a car has a red light and physically prevent them from moving forward, also increasing safety. This too is not feasible, however it made us think about ways that we could metaphorically stop cars if not physically.

              <p>Our idea was an app that could be presented through a heads up display, or on the dashboard, that showed users important information from the streets. This included nearby pedestrians, cyclists, other cars, important street signs, and obstructions in the word. This information would be collected through the smart street lights which are currently in place in downtown San Diego. This street lights have the capability to process images, which we would then transfer to the cars. This would highlight important information in case drivers missed something.

              <h5>Feedback</h5>
              <p>We submitted all of our user testing and prototype to the Design for San Diego challenge and received a lot of constructive feedback. The main concern was that this design would be more distracting than helpful.

                  We held a phone at the front and side of the car to capture different angles. We then skyped this screen to another phone and drew over objects that we viewed as a potential threat to safety, such as another car or pedestrian. We also tried to use auditory cues such as a beeping noise if a driver was in danger.

                  People rarely looked at our video, choosing to keep eyes on the road

                <li>
                  Beeping noises are also distracting and don't tell the driver what object to look out for
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even while using google maps, users rarely looked at the map or directions and mainly relied on the auditory information.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alerts should be contextual, and not identify all objects, only potential threats

              <br>
              <p>We decided to model our solution after google maps. The app would provide video footage of what was happening in the road if users wanted to glance at it, but not require them to always look at the interface for warnings. Our app would use auditory alerts by actually saying statements such as "watch out for the pedestrian". Additionally, the app will only alert drivers during dangerous situations. For example if the car was stopped while a pedestrian was crossing the street, there would not be an alert. The app would only warn the driver if the car started moving. 
              </p>
              <h5>Future Steps</h5>
              <p>
              We envision a future with a personal assistant in every car. As more cars begin to implement cameras with a 360 degree view, this will be the reality. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Some additional features we hope to provide is to integrate artificial intelligence into PAC and add the functionality of being to ask it questions such as: “Is it safe to make a right lane change?” In that way, our system would mimic the "front seat driver", who warns the driver of possible collisions.

                  Creating this helped us understand who might have interest in our project, why they have an interest, and how much influence they would have. This helped us address the proper way to design for each of our stakeholders. For example, although policymakers are concerned with lowering the amount of water used around California, the priorities and needs of gardeners is more important to us. 
                </p>
                <p>We conducted online research to gain context about our design challenge. Due do the drought and wildfired in California, policymakers have set laws restricting the amount of waters citizens can use, and setting heavy fines for wasting water.  We found that sprinkler systems are often wasteful, and spray water in areas beyond the garden. Drip irrigation is the most effective method of watering plants, however most people don't have the knowledge or ability to implement these systems. 
                </p>
                <p>Based on interviews with 16 gardeners around California, we created a user profile.

                <img src="eng 100d/diy sketch.PNG" alt="diy" style="">
                <p>
                  This design addresses the need for a cheap solution that can adapt to every type of garden. The design uses cheap recycled materials, and can be designed for every backyard. The strengths of this design is that it is environmentally sustainable, low budget, and adaptive because systems are created for specific gardens. It is open sourced, and provides a good opportunity for education. Some weaknesses are that this design has the potential of faster deterioration. It takes time to make and install the system from scratch, and people might have a hard time understanding instructions.

                <h5>Sensor Driven Sprinkler System</h5>
                <img src="eng 100d/solar powered drip irrigation sketch.PNG" alt="drip">
                <p>
                  The core need that this design solves is an automatic system that reduces the amount of water saved. This design has a water insert that leads to a bucket that filtrates water. The tank can hold up to two weeks of water. Solar panels power an arduino, alongside soil sensors. Together, the arduino controls linear motors to stop or allow flow to plants based on soil sensors. It flows to plants through a drip watering system which allows for variable flow rate. The strengths of this design are that the filtration device removes physical impurities, the soil sensors monitors soil water needs, and the drip irrigation efficiently delivers water to plants. Some weaknesses are that the soil sensor could be inaccurate, and it needs user input every two weeks to sustain water source.

                <p>
                  The core need that this design addresses is the desire to reduce water usage by using water efficiently. This design inputs water from a waterline, and waters as seen necessary based on a sensor chip. The excess water is collected at the bottom of the plants, and is then put back into the tank collecting water from a waterline. The strengths of this design are that it has sensor driven automation for efficiency. It is adaptable to different kinds of plant by adjusting the structure. Some weaknesses are that it has many different components means more things that could break or need replacement, and it might be difficult to teach users how to utilize and maintain the technology used.

                  Some problem that may arise from our design is that the materials can end up being costly and use up more resources, especially if people do not already own these materials. There is an education barrier, and people who are less tech-savvy might have difficulty implementing certain components. Additionally, the instructions may be hard for people to understand, and there are no other resources besides this guide to help gardeners. Future work would include video tutorials to help gardeners implement this design.
